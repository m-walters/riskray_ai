### Detecting at-risk hips using machine learning

**Note this repo is for personal use and not for reproduction**

Contents include a Mixed Data CNN for logistic image classification of x-ray images, distinguishing from control 
hips, and those at risk.

Also includes a basic GAN that I experimented with to try and bulk out the dataset. First attempts showed difficulty 
on ~400 image dataset.
